# Installation

The following dependencies are needed to run the LegoStacks processing sketch.

* Install OpenCV and the Processing OpenCV library: http://ubaa.net/shared/processing/opencv/
* Install the Fullscreen API for Processing: http://www.superduper.org/processing/fullscreen_api/
* Install the ControlP5 library: http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/#installation

# Tips

The recognition of Lego bricks is based on areas of homogenous color. 

* Despite the name, I actually used this program with Duplos, not Legos. The program can surely work with Legos, although the smaller size might be problematic.
* The recognition works best with a good webcam. Some older webcams have a lot of grain and low contrast, making the recognition difficult.
* The recognition works best in a well-lit environment with good ambient light. Direct sunlight or inconsistent lighting (for example, where people passing by can affect the lighting) don't work well.
* Try avoiding reflections on the surface of lego pieces.
* Putting a lamp on the side of the webcam can solve inconsistent lighting problems.
